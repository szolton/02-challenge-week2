The purpose of this assignment is to create a portfolio for our web design work. 

Since there are no projects yet, I subsituted some of my other design work.

I included a navigation system, responsive design, CSS, and a working about and contact sections.

I began by looking at different layouts, seeing what I like and also keeping it similar to my other portfolios (see: zoltondesign.com, zoltonillustration.myportfolio.com). I planned to keep the overall fonts and color scheme the same.

Then, I got to work figuring out the CSS and just working with the code. It includes 2-4 projects and copy. Getting started from scratch, I found an html skeleton code and built it up from there.

The real struggle for me was the about page and making the text on that page responsive and getting it to drop down below the image. I used a combination of chatgpt and troubleshooting with inspect to figure out what was wrong (I believe too many overlapping CSS entities).

Once the basics were done, I messed around with some other fun elements like gradients and small animations to create a full portfolio site.
