The purpose of this assignment is to create a portfolio for our web design work. 

Since there are no projects yet, I subsituted some of my other design work.

I included a navigation system, responsive design, CSS, and a working about and contact sections.

I began by looking at different layouts, seeing what I like and also keeping it similar to my other portfolios (see: zoltondesign.com, zoltonillustration.myportfolio.com). I planned to keep the overall fonts and color scheme the same.

Then, I got to work figuring out the CSS and just working with the code. It includes 1-2 projects and copy. The hard part was just getting started from scratch, but it was really fun once things started coming together.
